# codex-donuts-and-dragons
this is a compilation codex for the donuts and dragons campaign setting built with MkDocs

### that means this will become the 'easy to parse' human reference for my campaign setting and world. 

this was and is continued to be built for my use, so I will not be updating this app to cater to other users or other user experiences.

that being said, this can be used as reference if you decide to run your own campaign here. if you do, PLEASE let me know because that is awesome!
